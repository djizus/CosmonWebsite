        Earth 2500, there is no competent leader left to unite the
        multiplanetary human civilization against an imminent threat coming from
        space. In order to find a leader that could face this threat, a group of
        mad scientists on planet earth collected the DNA of all the most
        prominent conquerors and leaders of human history and worked
        relentlessly to clone them. <br /> <br />
        After having cloned them we ended up with thousands of clones and an
        urgent need to select the best ones.{' '}
