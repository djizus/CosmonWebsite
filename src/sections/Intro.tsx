          Earth 2500, there is no competent leader left to unite the
          multiplanetary human civilization against an imminent threat coming
          from space. In order to find a leader that could face this threat, a
          group of mad scientists on planet earth collected the DNA of all the
          most prominent conquerors and leaders of human history and worked
          relentlessly to clone them. <br /> <br />
          After having cloned them we ended up with thousands of clones and an
          urgent need to select the best ones.{' '}
