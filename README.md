# COSMON using Next.JS, Typescript & TailwindCSS

## Project structure

- `components` folder contains all the re-usable components
- `sections` folder contains sections of the website that are not supposed to be re-used (for code-splitting purposes)

The colors, fonts and theme are configured within `tailwind.config.js`

## Export as a static site

Run `yarn build` OR `npm run build` to export a static build of the website. The output should be inside the `out` generated folder.
